ahhh frick this, it took me a hour to first realise that in python you must use `listcopy = list[:]` and not simple `listcopy = list` and then hour and a half to realise that my program for some reason ignores the last ID from the file bruh.
it itself isnt really hard but the code you make may make it really hard, also I still didnt get to doing part 2
